# Bluetooth WIFI Connectivity Module
This is the repository for a WIFI Connectivity Module that uses Bleno JS to facilitate setting wifi connections for devices on which this application is deployed. This project was inspired by the need to connect digital displays powered by raspberry PIs to the host venue's wifi network. It removed the neccesity to remove the microcontroller's SD cards and edit the wpa files to connect without a monitor attached.
